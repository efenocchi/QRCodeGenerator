        "# Creating Artistic QR Codes at Scale Using LangChain and ControlNet\n",

        "## Summary\n",
        "We built a tool that can generate artistic QR codes for a specific website/url with the use of [Deep Lake](https://www.activeloop.ai/), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html), [Stable Diffusion](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/glossary/stable-diffusion/) and [ControlNet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet) via [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). If you want to try the code directly from our notebook, just download it from the [repository](https://github.com/efenocchi/QRCodeGenerator/blob/main/qr_code_article.ipynb).\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep Lake is a Database for AI, designed to efficiently store and search large-scale AI data including audio, video or embeddings from text documents, which will also be utilized in this article. It offers unique storage optimization for deep learning applications, featuring data streaming, vector search, data versioning, and seamless integration with other popular frameworks such as LangChain. This comprehensive toolkit is designed to simplify the process of developing workflows of large language model (LLM), and in our case we will focus on its capability to summarize and answer questions from large-scale documents such as web pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stable diffusion is a recent development in the field of image synthesis, with exciting potential for reducing high computational demand. It is primarily used for text-to-image generation, but is capable of variety of other tasks such as image modification, inpainting, outpainting, upscaling and generating image-to-image conditioned on text input. Meanwhile, ControlNet is an innovative neural network architecture that is a game-changer in managing the control of these diffusion models by integrating extra conditions. These control techniques include edge and line detection, human poses, image segmentation, depth maps, image styles or simple user scribbles. By applying these techniques, it is then possible to condition our output image with QR codes as well. In case you would be interested in more details, we recommend reading the [original ControlNet article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining all of this, we can achieve a scalable generation of QR codes that are very unique and more likely will attract attention. Overall, there are many possibilities you can approach this problem, and in this article, we will present those that we believe have the highest potential to impact advertising in the future. These are the steps that we are going to walk you through:\n",

In case you would be interested in perfectionizing your LLM prompts even further, we have an [amazing course](https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/take/langchain/multimedia/46317727-intro-to-prompt-engineering-tips-and-tricks) that will provide you many useful tips and tricks. Mastering prompts for image generation is, however, more art than science. Nevertheless, by providing the LLM with examples we can see that it can do a pretty good job by generating very specific image descriptions. Here are 3 different types of prompts that we were able to generate with our approach:\n",

        "`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Portrait prompt\n",

        "#### 3. Deep Lake prompt\n",

It is important to set the error correction level to 'H', which increases the probability of QR being readable, as 30% of the code can be covered/destroyed by an image. To generate a QR code with a logo, we created a function that takes the logo image and places it on the previously generated QR code. It is also important to note, that some of the URLs might be too long to generate a QR that is not too complicated and reliable enough for scanning. For this purpose, we can use url shorteners such as [bit.ly](bit.ly)."

        "First of all, we need to keep in mind that it is still very fresh and unexplored topic and the more pleasing-looking QRs you want to generate, the higher risk of not being readable by a scanner. This results in an endless cycle of adjusting parameters to find the most general setup. Many approaches can be applied, but their main difference is in ControlNet units. The highest success we had was with [brightness and tile preprocessors](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/tree/main), as well as the [qrcode preprocessor](https://huggingface.co/DionTimmer/controlnet_qrcode). Sometimes, adding a depth preprocessor was also helpful. A great guide on how to set up the Stable-diffusion webui with ControlNet extension to generate your first QR codes can be found for example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOY5J9UT_lY). Nevertheless, there is no single setup that would work 100% of the time and a lot of experimenting is needed, especially in terms of finetuning the control's strength/start/end to achieve a desirable output.\n",

The challenge is to generate QR code, while also keeping the product as similar to the original as possible to avoid misleading information. To do this, we experimented with many preprocessors such as the `tile`, `depth`, `reference_only`, `lineart` or `styles`, but we found most of them too unreliable and far from being similar to the original input. At this moment, we believe that the most useful  is the `tile` preprocessor, which can preserve a lot of information. The disadvantage is, however, that it does not allow for many changes during control phase and the QR fit can sometimes be questionable. In practice, this would be done by adding another CotntrolNet unit:\n",

        "### Limitations of Our Approach\n",
        "- Overall, the ControlNet model required extensive manual tuning of parameters. There are many methods to control the QR code generation process, but none are entirely reliable. The problem intensifies when you want to account for the input product image as well. To the best of our knowledge, no other publication has found a way to generate them reliably, and we spent the majority of our time experimenting with various setups.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Adding an image to the input might offer more control and bring about various use-cases, but it significantly restricts the possibilities of stable diffusion. This usually only results in changes to the image's style without fitting much of the QR structure. Moreover, we saw greater success with text-to-image compared to image-to-image with logo masks. However, the former wasn't as desirable because we believe logos are essential in product QR codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- From our examples, it's evident that the generated products don't exactly match the actual products one-to-one. If the goal is to advertise a specific product, even a minor mismatch could be misleading. Nonetheless, we believe that [LORA](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/lora/) models or a different type of preprocessor model could address these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Automated image prompts can sometimes be confusing, drawing focus to unimportant details within the context. This is particularly problematic if we don't have enough relevant textual information to build upon. This presents an opportunity to further use the Deep Lake Vector Store to analyze the image bind embeddings for a better understanding of the content on e-commerce websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In our examples, we also encountered issues with faces, as they sometimes didn't appear human. However, this could be easily addressed with further processing. In instances where we want to preserve the face and adjust it to the QR code, there are tools like the [Roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/sd-webui-roop) that can be used for a detailed face replacement.\n",

        "### Conclusion: Scalable Prompt Generation Achieved, QR Code Generation Remains Unreliable\n",
        "Deep Lake combined with LangChain can significantly reduce the costs of analyzing the contents of a website to provide image descriptions in a scalable way. Thanks to the Deep Lake Vector Store, we can save a large number of documents and images along with their embeddings. This allows us to iteratively adjust the image prompts and efficiently filter based on embedding similarities. However, it is very difficult to find the ControlNet sweet spot of QR readability and \"cool\" design. Taking into account all of the limitations we've discussed, we believe that there needs to be more experimenting with ControlNet, in order to generated product QR codes that are reliable and applicable for real-world businesses.\n",
